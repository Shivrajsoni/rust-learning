- saving blockchain data in a json file

- Create a simple protocol for nodes to share blocks
- Add node discovery mechanism
- Create a basic virtual machine for executing simple contracts (fuckkkkk)

**_Curious Question Arises_**

- how about making a blockChain in which main feature is to confirm all
